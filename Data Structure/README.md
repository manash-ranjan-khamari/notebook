# DATA STRUCTURE

- Space & Time complexity
- Big O, Big Theta, Big Omega Notations

## Big-O Notation
- Complexity in ascending order can be:

| Description       | Big-O     |
| ----------------- | --------- |
| Constant time     | O(1)      |
| Logarithmic time  | O(log(n)) |
| Linear time       | O(n)      |
| Linearithmic time | O(nlog(n))|
| Quadratic time    | O(n^2)    |
| Cubic time        | O(n^3)    |
| Exponential time  | O(b^n)    | b > 1
| Factorial time    | O(n!)     | 

## Linked List
- Single Linked List
- Doubly Linked List

## Priority Queue
- Abstract Data Type which is like a queue but follows a priority
- Can be implmented with any DS, but actually best implemented using Heaps

### Heaps
- Is a tree based DS
- Can be a min heap or a max heap
